# Create Imperium App ðŸš€

Welcome to **Create Imperium App** â€“ your all-in-one starter template for building cuttingâ€‘edge, multiâ€‘domain React applications using the Imperium framework by Leumas Tech! This template is designed to get you up and running fast with a clean, minimal, and highly customizable project structure. ðŸ˜Ž

## Overview

Create Imperium App bundles the core Imperium logic into a ready-to-use project scaffold. It separates the underlying Imperium core from your custom application code and configuration settings so you can focus on building amazing features without worrying about internal implementation details. When you generate a new project using this template, you'll receive a solid foundation with dedicated folders for:

- **Core:** Contains the Imperium logic and preâ€‘configured App component that acts as your application engine.
- **Config:** The place where you define and adjust your projectâ€™s default configurations.
- **Global:** Houses global settings that affect your entire application.
- **Source (src):** Your custom application code and entry point.

This structure is designed for flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

## Key Features âœ¨

- **Compiled Imperium Logic:** Enjoy a fully compiled version of the Imperium framework that is integrated seamlessly into your project while keeping all internal code hidden.
- **Seamless Customization:** Easily supply your own configuration and global settings, so you can tailor the app exactly to your needs.
- **Modern Tooling:** Built with Vite and React for a lightningâ€‘fast development experience and smooth build process.
- **Modular & Extensible:** A clear separation of core logic, configuration, and global settings makes it simple to extend and maintain your project over time.

## How to Get Started

1. **Generate Your Project:**  
   Use NPX or a similar tool to clone this template and set up your new Imperium app. This step downloads the preâ€‘configured project scaffold to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   After generating the project, navigate to your project folder and install all dependencies with your preferred package manager.

3. **Customize Configurations:**  
   Open the **config** and **global** folders to update the default settings (e.g., API keys, routes, endpoints, and other options) to match your application requirements.

4. **Run and Build Your App:**  
   Use the provided scripts to start the development server, test your app, or build the project for production deployment.

With this template, youâ€™re fully equipped to launch your Imperiumâ€‘powered React application in no time!

## Detailed Folder Structure

- **core/**  
  Contains the preâ€‘configured App component that wraps the Imperium logic. This core engine is the heart of your application and remains separate from your custom code.

- **config/**  
  Holds default configuration files that you can modify. Here you define routes, API endpoints, and other settings to personalize your project.

- **global/**  
  Contains global configuration settings that apply across your entire application. Adjust these to control overall behaviors and integrations.

- **src/**  
  Your main application code lives here, including the entry point (typically `main.jsx`), where you import the core App component and inject your configurations.

- **index.html**  
  The HTML template that provides the mounting point for your React application. It is the base of your projectâ€™s frontend.

- **Package and Build Files**  
  Files such as `package.json` and `vite.config.js` manage dependencies, scripts, and the build process, ensuring smooth development and deployment.

## Customization & Configuration

Create Imperium App is designed for maximum flexibility:
- **Define Routes:** Configure your public, protected, and shared routes to suit your projectâ€™s navigation and security needs.
- **Set API Endpoints:** Easily specify your own API endpoints and service URLs.
- **Adjust Global Settings:** Override default global settings to better align with your project requirements.
- **Extend Components:** As your project evolves, you can extend or override core components without altering the underlying Imperium logic.

The modular design ensures that while the core Imperium framework remains stable, every aspect of the application behavior can be fully tailored by you.
